## Round 3 Refinement Focus Points (R3-01 to R3-06)

1. **R3-01 (Explicit Artifact Ownership & Nullable Identity):** `lease_created`, `part_created`, `final_promoted` states explicitly track lifecycle; non-recorded identities are `None`; pre-existing foreign `snapshot.part` is never deleted during cleanup (`test_r3_01_pre_existing_candidate_part_not_deleted`).
2. **R3-02 (Immediate Cleanup Scope After Lease mkdir):** Cleanup begins immediately after successful `mkdir`; early failure on `chmod` or `lstat` cleans up the newly created lease directory without leaving orphaned folders (`test_r3_02_early_lease_mkdir_cleanup_on_stat_failure`).
3. **R3-03 (FD Lifecycle, Short-Write Taxonomy & Zero FD Leak):** All secondary errors in `_open_source_nofollow` mapped to `XlsxSourceNotReadyError`; Candidate `fstat`/open errors mapped to `XlsxSnapshotStorageError`; short write or `None` write returns mapped to `XlsxSnapshotStorageError`; zero FD leaks verified across success, consumer crashes, and faults via `/proc/self/fd` (`test_r3_03_fd_lifecycle_and_zero_fd_leak`, `test_r3_03_short_write_and_write_failure_taxonomy`).
4. **R3-04 (Post-Promotion Attestation & No Leaf Resolve):** Promoted file is attested without following symlinks and compared to recorded candidate identity; `snapshot_path` is constructed safely without resolving through leaf symlinks (`test_r3_04_post_promotion_attestation_and_no_path_resolve`).
5. **R3-05 (Zero Sentinels Removed / Valid `mtime_ns = 0`):** `mtime_ns = 0` (Epoch 1970) is treated as a valid timestamp and strictly verified; modifications during lease trigger `XlsxSnapshotIntegrityError` (`test_r3_05_valid_zero_mtime_ns_integrity`).
6. **R3-06 (ZIP Validation on Candidate Handle & Real Flush Failure):** ZIP Central Directory validation executed on verified Candidate handle with nofollow; real flush failure verified via stream wrapper (`test_r3_06_real_flush_failure_taxonomy`).

## Coverage gaps

- None for local Linux platform.
- Windows runtime execution and benchmark metrics remain PENDING independent Codex CI execution on PR.

---

## Gate statement

- Gate G1 status remains `OPEN / IN PROGRESS`.
- Implementer status for WP-06 is `REQUEST_CHANGES` pending Codex PR review and merge.
