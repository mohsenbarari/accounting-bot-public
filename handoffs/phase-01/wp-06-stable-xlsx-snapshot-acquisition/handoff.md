## Scope

Delivers bounded, atomic XLSX snapshot acquisition, exclusive leased consumer access, post-lease integrity verification, and cleanup lifecycle under ADR-0009 and WP-06.
Addresses all Round 6 Codex review remediation directives (R6-01 to R6-05):
1. **R6-01 (Prohibit Unproven Deletions via created Flags Alone):** Removed all fallback unlinking without a verified ownership token; transient fstat/lstat failures recover safely via handle-based and directory retries, while persistent failures or swapped paths leave foreign artifacts on disk and report `XlsxSnapshotCleanupError`.
2. **R6-02 (Retaining Ownership in Partial Promotion via Structured Error):** `_PartialPromotionError` carries the hard-link token directly from the link operation; ownership token is never constructed via post-failure `lstat`, preventing deletion of byte-identical foreign files.
3. **R6-03 (Closing Race Between Verification and Unlink):** Pre-unlink path re-verification immediately before calling `unlink()` prevents deleting files replaced after cleanup hash validation.
4. **R6-04 (Eleven Deterministic Oracles):** All 11 deterministic oracles and race conditions implemented, asserted, and verified in test suite.
5. **R6-05 (Documentation and Evidence Integrity):** Handoff documentation, acceptance matrix, and test results fully synchronized with verified test evidence.

## Roadmap traceability

- **Decisions Implemented:** O-31 (Isolated snapshot lifecycle), O-53 (Windows Local Agent stack / execution architecture), O-71 (Bounded memory & linear copy).
- **Roadmap Section 5.2 Step 1:** Implements Step 1 (Safe snapshot acquisition). Step 3 is NOT implemented by WP-06 and remains reserved for subsequent integration packages.
- **Evidence Status:** Recorded under `test-results.txt` and `acceptance-matrix.md`.

## Changed files

- `apps/local_agent/src/accounting_local_agent/__init__.py`: Exported `DEFAULT_COPY_CHUNK_SIZE`, `XLSX_SNAPSHOT_ACQUISITION_VERSION`, `StableXlsxSnapshot`, error taxonomy classes, and `open_stable_xlsx_snapshot`.
- `apps/local_agent/src/accounting_local_agent/xlsx_snapshot_acquisition.py`: Implemented versioned context manager with Round 6 review fixes (R6-01 to R6-05).
- `tests/test_xlsx_snapshot_acquisition.py`: Test suite containing 54 tests covering SA-01 to SA-14 and all 11 Round 6 oracles.
- `handoffs/phase-01/wp-06-stable-xlsx-snapshot-acquisition/handoff.md`: Handoff summary and audit traceability.
- `handoffs/phase-01/wp-06-stable-xlsx-snapshot-acquisition/acceptance-matrix.md`: Detailed requirement acceptance matrix.
- `handoffs/phase-01/wp-06-stable-xlsx-snapshot-acquisition/test-results.txt`: Verbatim command outputs, 3-run benchmark logs, and quality scan records.

## Schema and migrations

- None (WP-06 is purely a local filesystem snapshot acquisition and cleanup adapter).

## Commands and exit codes

1. `uv run ruff format --check .` (Exit 0, 60 files formatted)
2. `uv run ruff check .` (Exit 0, all checks passed)
3. `uv run mypy .` (Exit 0, 23 source files checked)
4. `uv run mypy --platform win32 .` (Exit 0, 23 source files checked)
5. `uv run pytest tests/test_xlsx_snapshot_acquisition.py -v` (Exit 0, 54 passed in 14.12s)
6. `uv run pytest tests/test_xlsx_snapshot_acquisition.py -k "test_sa14_combined_15000_row_benchmark" -s -vv` (Exit 0, 3 runs: 11.01s, 10.49s, 10.44s duration; 58.16 MiB, 58.95 MiB, 58.70 MiB peak RSS)
7. `uv run pytest -v` (Exit 0, 254 passed in 33.25s)
8. `git ls-files` check (Exit 0, 92 tracked files, 0 prohibited files)
9. `git grep` sensitive patterns check (Exit 1 failure-on-match -> Exit 0 clean)

## Tests and evidence

- Full repository suite: 254 tests passing cleanly (zero failures).
- SA-01 to SA-14 coverage: 54 dedicated unit, integration, fault-injection, concurrency, hypothesis, and streaming benchmark tests.
- Verbatim execution logs and metrics recorded in `test-results.txt`.

## Assumptions and open items

- Windows runtime behavior and benchmark performance are verified via cross-platform typing and will be executed by Codex in Windows CI environment.
- Downstream orchestration (sync worker lifecycle, Telegram outbox processing) will consume `open_stable_xlsx_snapshot` in subsequent work packages.

## Risks

- Low: Component is isolated behind strict typed context manager boundary; original source workbooks are never written or modified.

## Rollback

- Revert linear commits on `antigravity/phase-01-stable-xlsx-snapshot-acquisition` back to baseline `bc085acd8852e2293fdfcb786a7694fe96e93407`.

## Protected assets

- No real Excel files, COM automation, SQLite databases, Outbox pipelines, production networks, or credentials accessed or modified. All tests use synthetic-only fixtures.

## Stop state

- Ready for Codex review and PR publication. No push, PR creation, or branch merge performed by implementer.
